This is the code repository for [Game Development Patterns with Unity 2019 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/in/game-development/game-development-patterns-with-unity-2019-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Unity is the world’s leading cross-platform game engine. It has helped create about half of the world’s games. This course will help you learn the game development patterns and best practices in Unity 2019. This course will guide you through Unity’s modern features, showing you how to divide work to get your game made faster, built faster, and modularize behaviours so you can spend less time coding and more time creating. You’ll understand some of its more powerful features to raise your game’s performance, and code reusability while lowering your development iteration times. By using these techniques, your scripts become more versatile, modular, reusable, efficient, and user-friendly so that they can be used to easily build a virtual world from generalized components. This modular approach also allows a game to be assembled by multiple people in parallel with minimal downtime spent waiting for other parts to be complete. By the end of the course, you’ll be proficient in using the common patterns that will help you write clean and modular code quickly and efficiently and have a working framework to manage your game’s runtime, ready for your assets.
